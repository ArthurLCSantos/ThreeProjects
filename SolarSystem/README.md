# 🌞🚀 Solar System Simulation with Three.js 🌍✨

Welcome to this interactive **Solar System simulation** built with **Three.js**! Explore the planets, the Sun, and their orbits in a beautiful 3D environment with smooth controls.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project visualizes the Sun and major planets of our solar system with realistic textures and animations:

- 🌞 Sun with glowing Fresnel effect and intense light source  
- 🪐 Planets including Mercury, Venus, Earth (with clouds and night lights), Mars, Jupiter, Saturn (with rings), Uranus, and Neptune  
- 🌕 Earth’s Moon orbiting around Earth  
- ✨ Starry background to simulate deep space  
- 🔄 Orbital movement of planets and moon with rotational animation  
- 🕹️ Camera controls using **OrbitControls** to zoom, pan, and rotate around selected planets  



## 🛠️ Features

- Realistic planet sizes and distances (scaled for visualization)  
- Textured spheres with multiple materials (e.g., Earth’s clouds and night lights)  
- Dynamic lighting and glow effects with custom Fresnel shaders  
- Keyboard navigation to cycle through planets (ArrowLeft and ArrowRight)  
- Smooth camera zoom and target focusing on the currently selected planet

## 🚀 Installation & Running
Because this project uses ES6 modules and WebAssembly from external CDNs, it must be run from a local development server.

To run it with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):

1. Make sure you are in the `SolarSystem` project folder.
2. Run the project with:

   ```bash
   npx vite
   ```

## 🎨 Technologies Used
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Vite for fast development server

## 🎮 How to Use

- Use mouse to rotate, zoom, and pan the view
- Press **← (ArrowLeft)** to move to the next planet
- Press **→ (ArrowRight)** to move to the previous planet
- Watch planets orbit smoothly around the Sun with realistic rotations
